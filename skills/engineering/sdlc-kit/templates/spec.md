# Spec: <feature slug>

- From: intent.md (approved YYYY-MM-DD)
- Type: greenfield | brownfield

## Human summary (read this first)

<The bottom line, then five or fewer `**→**` points (AGENTS.md rule 8): the
problem, what gets built, what stays unchanged, each flagged concern with your
recommendation. For a reader with no technical background: what a user can or
cannot do, not system internals. Approvable from this section and Flagged
concerns alone.>

## Requirements
<each cites the intent.md O-item it fulfils; each machine-checkable. An O-item
with no R is a flagged concern, never a silent drop.>
- R1: <requirement> (O1)

## Data shapes
<schemas, API contracts, migrations, and serialization end to end>

## Behavior: AS-IS → TO-BE
<For each flow, record what happens today and what happens after the change.
For brownfield work, cite explorer or browser evidence for AS-IS. For each
listed existing flow, behavior not changed in TO-BE belongs in "What stays
untouched." Include empty, huge, concurrent, unauthorized, and malformed
cases where they apply.>

| # | Flow | AS-IS (evidence) | TO-BE |
|---|------|------------------|-------|
| B1 | <flow> | <today, with source> | <after> |

## Business rules touched   <!-- from the area page(s) summary.md names; the verifier re-checks every kept one -->
- <area> P1: kept · P3: changed → R2 · P4: retired → R5 · new rule → R6
- <area> N1: kept · N2: changed → R2 · new figure → R6   <!-- only if the area page has a Numbers section; same treatment as business rules -->

## What stays untouched   <!-- brownfield: testable statements; becomes regression baseline -->
- U1: <existing behavior>; checked by <command/test>

## Release procedure
<one line; ship follows this; "none" is a valid deploy command>
- branch `feat/<slug>` → merge to `<target>` → push → deploy: `<command | none>`

## Flagged concerns
<List concerns for human decision at the gate.>
- [ ] <concern>; owner: <security/compliance/UX/...>

## Open questions from intent
- <question>: <answered: how | carried forward>

## Adversarial review
<objections raised and resolutions; this records that the review occurred>
- <objection>: <resolution>
