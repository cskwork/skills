# Stage 6: Maintain

Goal: turn each bug report, incident, alert, or ticket into a diagnosed
`intent.md`. Restart the process with evidence, not a vague complaint. People
triage and review the work. They do not create the initial diagnosis.

Heartbeat throughout: AGENTS.md rule 9.

## Running headless? Sandbox first

This stage may start without a human through cron, a webhook, or a ticket. Run
it stateless in a sandbox with scoped, read-only access to logs, metrics, and
code. Do not provide standing production credentials or deploy tools. The
agent may act only through gated routes: write an `intent.md`, open a review
PR, or run a pre-approved runbook. A wrong diagnosis may produce a wrong
document, but it must never change production. Handle rollback through the plan gate or the project's
rehearsed rollback runbook. Never revert production directly from this stage.

## Intake (before any research or hypothesis)

Ask the reporter these five questions in one message. Skip any already
answered. Each answer kills hypothesis classes for free; a researcher
fan-out dispatched before these answers wastes most of its budget.

**Headless, or no reachable reporter?** Do not stall on an interview nobody
will answer. Answer every question you can from the ticket text, the logs, the
deploy record, and the code — that is where most of these answers already
live — label each one `[verified: how]` or `[assumed: why]` in intent.md, and
carry only what is left. What remains is material only if a wrong answer would
change what gets built or exceed the authorized scope: those go to the human
as `## Material questions` and the loop stops for them (AGENTS.md rule 3).
Everything else is an `[assumed]` line and the diagnosis continues.

1. What exactly was done, with what input? (the control clicked, the
   request sent, the command run, the job or schedule that fired)
2. What happened, and what was expected instead? (nothing at all, an error,
   a wrong result, a partial change, slow) — each is a different bug class.
   The area page's business rules (`tools/kb.sh show <area>`) are the first
   reference for "expected"; a report that contradicts one is a question
   about the rule, not yet a bug.
3. Where and when? (environment, URL or host, version, time window — this
   picks the deployed ref and the log window)
4. As whom? (account, role, tenant, client — permissions and data scope
   change behavior)
5. What trace exists? (screenshot, console or network capture, request or
   trace id, log line, the affected record keys) If none, can it be
   reproduced once with capture on?

Record the answers in `intent.md` under Evidence. Track question 5
explicitly (see Evidence tracking below).

## Diagnose

0. **Check the deployed source first.** Run `tools/refcheck.sh
   origin/<deploy-branch> [--deployed-sha <sha from the release system or
   runtime>] <suspected paths>` from the repo root. Exit 1 (drift): read
   every listed file via `git show <rev>:<path>` and name the revision behind
   each fact. Exit 2 (unknown ref, failed fetch, no repo): you know nothing
   about the running code — say exactly that; do not read the working tree
   as if it were live. Without `--deployed-sha` the deployed revision is
   UNKNOWN and the branch ref is a stand-in, never deployment evidence.
1. Run the cheap probes in `probes.md` (same directory) that match the
   symptom BEFORE dispatching researcher fan-out. Probes cost seconds and
   set direction; fan-out is for breadth the probes cannot cover.
2. Before forming a hypothesis or offering options, run fresh-context history
   and feasibility research under skill 1. Check whether this failure was fixed
   or reverted before, why, and whether it can be reproduced here.
3. Reproduce the issue first, as a failing test wherever one can reach the
   defect (AGENTS.md rule 6). Draft it in `scratch/` or a disposable
   worktree — the source tree stays untouched until the intent gate — and
   cite its failing output in intent.md's Evidence; build adds it to the
   suite first. If it cannot be reproduced, the honest outputs
   are a diagnosis, instrumentation, or a defensive change labelled as
   unconfirmed — never "fixed".
4. Trace the cause. After memory (AGENTS.md rule 4), ask the store directly
   whether this has been seen before:
   `tools/kb.sh search "<the error text>"`, `tools/kb.sh search "<the
   module or endpoint>"`, and `tools/kb.sh show <slug>` for the features
   the hits name — the search covers closed features, so a fix from two
   years ago comes back with its evidence and delivery record. Cite what
   you find by path in the diagnosis. Records of a checkout that no longer
   exists are reachable the same way with `--area <folder>`.
5. Name the symptom class before hunting; each has its own checklist:
   *nothing happened* (handler not reached, swallowed error, missing
   timeout — probes 7, 8), *wrong result* (logic or data: which query,
   which record, which version — probes 2, 3), *looks wrong* (rendering
   until proven otherwise), *intermittent* (concurrency, caching,
   environment, data-dependent). No cause from the probes? List the rival
   causes first, then eliminate them by runtime observation, each pass
   taking the check that removes the most. Record each rival and what killed
   it in intent.md's Evidence; a trial change a refuted one motivated is
   discarded, never carried into the fix.
6. **Class sweep and caller audit** (probes 4, 5): one instance is a bug;
   the count table is the scope, and it decides fix ordering.
7. Check the feature's `evidence.md` — a shipped feature is archived, so it
   sits at `.sdlc/archive/<slug>/evidence.md` (`tools/kb.sh show <slug>`
   names the path): was this covered by proof, or was it a verification gap? A gap is itself a lesson (`promote: skills/5-ship`).

## Evidence tracking

Reproduction evidence requested from a human tends to evaporate in chat.
Make its state explicit in `intent.md`:

    - reproduction evidence: requested 2026-08-29 (console+network capture)
      → update to: received <date> | waived-by-human <date, why>

A diagnosis that ships while evidence is `requested` must say so in its
report and in any ticket it produces. Do not silently drop the request.
Ask at most twice. After the second unanswered request, either proceed
with `waived-by-agent <date> — unreproduced; diagnosis stays [assumed]`
carried into every downstream artifact, or close the fix-slug handed-off
with the reporter's ticket key. Never re-request a third time.
**A waiver waives the REQUEST, never the proof.** It says "stop asking the
reporter", not "this is reproduced". Work that continues under a waiver is
unconfirmed by definition: it may ship as instrumentation, a defensive
change, or a documented hypothesis, and it says so in evidence.md's Bug
proof section. If it is later reproduced, the full chain (AGENTS.md rule 6)
applies before anything is called fixed.
If `.sdlc/config.md` has empty `test:`/`lint:` commands, record one line of
verification debt in the artifact: what could not be run, and what manual
check replaced it.

## Adversarial review of the diagnosis (before the fix plan is approved)

A confident diagnosis built without reproduction NEEDS hostile review.
Dispatch fresh-context adversaries (rule 5 of AGENTS.md) with these four
standing assignments — each has caught real errors:

1. **Recount.** Redo every enumeration independently (counts of queries,
   call sites, guards). Watch for aliases and pattern variants the first
   pass missed.
2. **Propagation proof.** For each claimed error mechanism, prove the error
   can actually REACH the code the fix would touch. A layer that swallows
   its own errors refutes the fix above it.
3. **Zero-risk attack.** Attack every "zero risk", "never happens",
   "always" phrase. Enumerate the states where the impossible thing is
   normal today.
4. **Rival hypothesis.** Propose at least one alternative that fits the
   same evidence, and name the single observation that would distinguish it.

## Route by size

Incidents use the same two routes as everything else (AGENTS.md "Two routes,
one contract"). There is no separate compressed loop.

- **Compact route.** Use it when one cause is reproduced, the changed file
  set is known, and affected behavior is limited. Create a new
  `.sdlc/work/<fix-slug>/` directory so prior approvals stay intact, and
  write ONE work artifact: `intent.md` with `- Track: compact`, carrying the
  reproduction and diagnosis as verified evidence plus the Compact route
  section (Files · Proof · Risk · Baseline · Delivery target), and a
  summary.md naming the product area (skills/1-intent "Write the
  artifact"). Pass the intent gate,
  then build and verify under skill 4, then ship. No spec.md, no plan.md, and
  nothing downstream asks for one.
- **Full route.** Use it for everything else — an unclear cause, a wide blast
  radius, or risky ground. Create `.sdlc/work/<new-slug>/intent.md` from
  `templates/intent.md` with `- Track: full` and run Stage 1.

**Recurrence cap: three fix loops for one symptom.** Before opening a
fix-slug, grep the symptom's tags in INDEX.md AND open features' harvests
(`tools/kb.sh harvest`, `tools/kb.sh search "<tag>"`) — in-flight lessons
are not merged yet. On the third match, stop fixing and start investigating: the repetition is
evidence that the cause found so far is not the cause. Widen the
investigation — what the three incidents share, which invariant keeps
breaking, what the earlier fixes actually changed — and take the finding to
the human as a design decision, with the promotion edit the tag has earned.
"It is architectural" is a conclusion the widened investigation may reach,
not a verdict to assert in place of one. Record the outcome in DOMAIN.md as a constraint at close.
Per-feature caps do not bound a defect that mints a new slug per incident;
this rule does.

## Record the lesson (only when it is reusable)

A lesson earns its place by changing what a future run does: a trap, a
non-obvious constraint, a wrong assumption that cost time. An incident whose
cause was local and obvious leaves no lesson, and "no lesson from this one"
is a valid, complete answer — INDEX.md is a 50-line budget, and filler
crowds out the entries that matter. Durable facts about the system are
domain candidates, not lessons. A human correction, or context the human
supplied that a tool could have fetched, is a candidate at once. What a
skill already says is an execution miss, not a lesson: propose sharpening or
moving that rule instead.

When there is one, draft it in the fix feature's
`.sdlc/work/<fix-slug>/harvest.md` (AGENTS.md rule 4). The close merge materializes it as `.sdlc/memory/lessons/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`
via `templates/lesson.md` plus ONE line in `.sdlc/memory/INDEX.md`:

```
- [tags,comma,separated] one-line summary → lessons/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md
```

Memory discipline (context stays bounded):

- Keep INDEX.md at 50 lines or fewer. If it grows past the limit, merge
  near-duplicates, drop superseded entries (their subject changed), and
  replace promoted entries with one line — `- [tags] promoted → <the
  project check, or skills/<n>> (was 3×)` — so the recurrence count survives
  the prune.
- When the same lesson recurs for a second time, propose the exact edit that
  would prevent it — the strongest mechanism that fits: a test, lint rule, or
  check in the project first (it enforces without being read), then a
  `check:` line in the verify recipe, a stage-skill edit last.
  (Distinct from the 3× tag rule in skills/5-ship:
  this fires on the same lesson, that one on the same tag.)
- State the trap and the correct move in each lesson. Keep it short and
  specific enough to change behavior.
