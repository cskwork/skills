# handoff.sh — the review handoff: get the reviewed source onto a feature branch
# a human can review, and prove it is there. Run from the project root.
#
#   tools/handoff.sh check <slug> [--remote <r>] [--branch <b>]
#   tools/handoff.sh push  <slug> --authorized "<the human's words>" [--remote <r>] [--branch <b>]
#
# The boundary this script draws is the point of the whole automation layer:
#
#   review-ready  — the feature branch exists on the remote at the delivered
#                   commit, and that commit CONTAINS the source the ship review
#                   saw. A human review of that branch is the next step.
#   merged/deployed — NOT this script's business. Merging a feature branch or
#                   deploying it leaves the review boundary, so delivery.md must
#                   carry `Authorized-by:` with the human's own words for it, at
#                   every lazymode level (AGENTS.md rule 3 "Autonomy is not
#                   authority"). `check` refuses to call it done without one.
#
# Guard rails on `push`, all of them checked IMMEDIATELY BEFORE the side effect:
#
#   * the complete ship gate — gates/check-gate.sh ship, the same program the
#     agent runs by hand: the approval must bind this artifact, its upstreams
#     and the reviewed source. A ship gate that is CLOSED for any reason
#     (an evidence.md edited after approval, source drift, an unbound record)
#     refuses the push, in check-gate.sh's own words;
#   * the verification receipt — a configured recipe must read `ok`;
#   * AUTHORITY — `--authorized` is required, AND the scope the human recorded
#     in intent.md (`- Scope authorization:`) must actually name publishing a
#     branch. A flag an agent types is not permission; neither is a line an
#     agent wrote into delivery.md. Both are records, not authentication (L2).
#   * a `local` delivery target is never pushed;
#   * protected/shared branches are refused (`protected_branches:` in
#     .sdlc/config.md plus a built-in list), --force/--force-with-lease are
#     refused outright, and a remote branch that has drifted away from this
#     history (not an ancestor of HEAD) stops the push instead of racing it.
#
# A push whose remote branch is already at this commit is reported and NOT
# repeated, so a resume cannot double-fire an external effect.
#
# Exit: 0 ok · 1 refusal, mismatch, or failed push · 2 usage/environment.
