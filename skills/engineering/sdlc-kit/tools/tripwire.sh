# tripwire.sh <artifact> — SUPPLEMENTAL keyword scan for trip-wires
# (AGENTS.md rule 3). It reads English keywords in one Markdown file, so it
# misses risky work described in any other language, in a paraphrase, or only
# in the code the artifact points at.
# One-directional by design: a hit ADDS a requirement (risk authorization,
# adversary review); a clean scan REMOVES nothing and authorizes nothing. The
# risk review is a read of the affected code and behavior, never this output.

# scanned like any other text, and line numbers stay the file's own.
