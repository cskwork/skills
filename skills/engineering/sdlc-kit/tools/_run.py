"""_run.py — bounded process execution for tools/verify.sh. Not a user command.

A POSIX shell cannot portably (a) put a child in its own process group, (b) kill
that whole group, or (c) bound a command by wall clock without `timeout(1)`,
which stock macOS does not ship. `tools/verify.sh` therefore delegates those
three things here. Nothing else in the kit depends on this file: the gates,
`tools/auto.sh` and `tools/handoff.sh` remain shell + git only.

Subcommands (all take --cmd as ONE shell string, run through `sh -c`):

  exec   --cmd C --log F --timeout S      run C to completion, stdin </dev/null,
         [--cwd D]                        in D when given (the baseline's base
                                          worktree), output appended to F, then
                                          F's credentials redacted. Exit = the
                                          command's own status, or 124 on
                                          timeout (the whole process group is
                                          terminated, then killed). INT/TERM
                                          reaching this helper take that same
                                          group down at once and exit 128+signal,
                                          so an interrupted verification stops
                                          the command it is running instead of
                                          waiting for it.
  launch --cmd C --log F --pidfile P      start C detached in its OWN process
                                          group, record that group id in P, and
                                          return at once. Exit 0 when the group
                                          is alive after the handshake wait.
  alive  --pidfile P                      exit 0 while any member of the
                                          recorded group is alive. The probe is
                                          non-destructive on every platform: it
                                          never signals what it is asking about.
  stop   --pidfile P --timeout S          terminate the whole recorded group
                                          (TERM, then KILL). Exit 0 only when
                                          nothing of it is left; 1 says so
                                          explicitly instead of hanging.
  redact --log F                          redact credentials in F in place (the
                                          launched runtime's log, once stopped).

Exit 2 is a usage or environment error of this helper itself.

Windows (Git Bash is a first-class target) has neither process groups nor
signals in the POSIX sense, so the same three jobs are done with the native
equivalents: OpenProcess/WaitForSingleObject for liveness, `taskkill /T /F` for
the tree, and — for `exec` only — a job object that dies with this helper, so a
command it is waiting on is not orphaned (still holding its log file open) when
MSYS `kill` terminates this process outright. A LAUNCHED runtime is deliberately
not in that job: it has to outlive the helper that started it.

Two limits of that containment, stated rather than assumed:
  * It is not guaranteed to exist. If the job object cannot be created,
    configured or assigned, this helper says so by name on stderr and in the
    run's `--log` and keeps going WITHOUT claiming the containment. It never
    reports it as working when it is not; an interrupted run still exits
    non-zero and still writes no receipt.
  * The child is assigned to the job just AFTER `subprocess.Popen` returns, so a
    grandchild created inside that window is outside the job. The window cannot
    be closed from here (`CREATE_SUSPENDED` is not usable: CPython closes the
    child's thread handle before returning, leaving nothing to resume), and it
    is small but not zero.
