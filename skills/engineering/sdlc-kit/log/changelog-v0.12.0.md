# v0.12.0 — records out of git, an external knowledge area, and retrieval

Records are the project's knowledge, not its source. `init.sh` now ignores the
whole of `.sdlc/` with one anchored rule, an optional external area keeps a
checkout's store outside the checkout entirely, and `tools/kb.sh` is the way to
read any of it back. Gate authority, tamper detection, source binding, the
`--json` automation schema and lazymode are unchanged in kind.

## Changes

- **One ignore rule: `/.sdlc`.** `init.sh` writes it, anchored to the project root, so it matches this project's records — a real directory or the symlink an external area installs — and never a `.sdlc` deeper in the tree (a nested shipping unit keeps its own rule, written by its own init run). The twenty narrower kit-owned lines earlier versions issued are subsumed and removed by exact match; a CRLF `.gitignore` is handled, and every other line, its bytes and its line ending, is written back untouched — read and written by the shell itself, never through an awk that may translate line endings on Windows. **The git index is never touched**: records already committed by an older kit stay committed until you untrack them yourself, and `init.sh` prints the exact command.
- **`init.sh [dir] --area <folder>` — an external knowledge area.** The store is `<folder>/<unit>-<checkout-id>/`, `.sdlc` is a symlink to it, and `<store>/PROJECT` records the owning checkout, its unit, its id, the creation time and the kit version. One store per checkout, so two worktrees or two same-named clones never share approvals. Refused, writing nothing: an area inside the project, a project inside the area (checked before any folder is created), a store another checkout owns, a directory that is not a store, an unwritable area (refused by the writability test and, if that test cannot see the right — a Windows deny ACL — by the first real write, before anything is linked), a `.sdlc` link that points elsewhere, or a link the filesystem cannot create.
- **Ownership is enforced at runtime, not only at init.** `check-gate.sh`, `approve.sh`, `close.sh`, `status.sh` (prose and `--json`), `tools/auto.sh`, `tools/verify.sh`, `tools/handoff.sh`, `init.sh` (including an ordinary re-run) and `tools/kb.sh index` all refuse, before any verdict and before any write, when the store they reach names a different checkout, carries no ownership record, or carries an unreadable one. This closes a real accident: `cp -R`, rsync, `tar` without `--dereference` and most backup restores preserve the `.sdlc` symlink, so a copied working copy resolved into the ORIGINAL's store and could read its approvals and archive its features. An ordinary project-local `.sdlc` directory has no `PROJECT` record, needs none, and is unaffected.
- **Nothing is migrated, re-bound, or moved for you.** A refusal prints the store, the recorded owner, this checkout, how to read the records (`tools/kb.sh --store/--area`), how to give this checkout a store of its own, and — for a renamed or moved checkout — the one manual line to edit (`project:` in `<store>/PROJECT`). A real `.sdlc` directory is never relocated by `--area`; it keeps working exactly as it is.
- **`tools/kb.sh` — reading the records back.** `index` regenerates a store's contents page (`init.sh` and `close.sh` run it; a `README.md` it did not generate is never overwritten), `show <slug>` prints one feature's goal, track, documents, delivery and lessons, `search "<text>"` is a bounded literal (`grep -F`) search across open and closed features and durable memory, and `list` names stores and features. `--area <folder>` covers every owned store in that folder, read-only and one level deep, following no symlinks — **including features whose checkout no longer exists**. `scratch/`, `approvals/`, `progress.md`, `baseline.txt`, `checkpoint.md` and `verify-receipt.md` are never read. Exit codes: `0` found, `1` nothing found, `2` usage error or refusal.
- **Readable store names.** Only path-hostile characters are replaced in the unit name, so a Korean, Japanese or accented checkout name stays legible in the area listing and in `kb.sh` output (`지식-프로젝트-e2117a76`), instead of collapsing to `project-<id>`.
- **The source snapshot excludes the bare `.sdlc` entry** as well as its descendants, in both the working-source list and the committed-tree enumeration, so an external store's symlink is never bound by a ship approval and moving the area is not drift.
- **Stage guidance and docs.** `skills/1-intent`, `skills/5-ship`, `skills/6-maintain`, `templates/evidence.md`, `AGENTS.md` rule 7, `SKILL.md`, both READMEs, `docs/index.html` and `docs/automation.md` state the same storage behaviour: records are ignored by default, a clone does not carry them, the store is yours to back up, and a stage starts with a targeted `kb.sh search`/`show` instead of scanning the archive.

## Usage

```sh
# default: records stay in the checkout, ignored by git
~/sdlc-kit/init.sh .

# or keep this checkout's records outside it, in a folder you choose
~/sdlc-kit/init.sh . --area ~/knowledge
#   → ~/knowledge/<unit>-<checkout-id>/ , with .sdlc linked to it

# read the records back, from the project
~/sdlc-kit/tools/kb.sh index                       # refresh this store's contents page
~/sdlc-kit/tools/kb.sh show   260920-login-fix     # one feature: goal, documents, delivery, lessons
~/sdlc-kit/tools/kb.sh search "rate limit"         # bounded literal search

# … or across every store in the area, from anywhere, read-only
~/sdlc-kit/tools/kb.sh list   --area ~/knowledge
~/sdlc-kit/tools/kb.sh show   260920-login-fix --area ~/knowledge
~/sdlc-kit/tools/kb.sh search "rate limit" --area ~/knowledge --limit 20
```

## Upgrade notes

- **Existing projects keep working.** Re-run `init.sh` to get the single `/.sdlc` rule and the cleanup of the lines it subsumes. Your existing records are not moved, rewritten or deleted, and **the git index is left exactly as it is** — already-committed records stay in history until you run the untracking command `init.sh` prints.
- **There is no automated migration**, by design. `--area` never relocates a real `.sdlc` directory: to use an area for a checkout that already has local records, move them aside yourself and let `init.sh` create an empty store; the old records stay readable with `tools/kb.sh --store <path>`.
- **Approval state is per checkout; retrieval is area-wide.** Gates, status, verification and handoff answer only for the checkout that owns the store. Reading (`kb.sh list|show|search`, with or without `--area`) is not bound to any checkout, which is what lets knowledge outlive the worktree that produced it.
- **Backups and versioning of the store are yours**, whichever location you choose: git no longer carries the records, and this kit adds no backup mechanism.
- **Windows:** `--area` requires real symlinks — run Git Bash with `MSYS=winsymlinks:nativestrict`. `init.sh` fails loudly if the link comes out as a copy rather than creating a forked store, and `gates/knowledge-test.sh` reports the external-area cases as NOT VERIFIED where the filesystem cannot link at all.
- `docs/index.html` no longer describes the durable record as committable; that policy is the one this release inverts.

## Validation

Local, on macOS (darwin 25.6.0, arm64, GNU bash 3.2.57, git 2.54.0, APFS
case-insensitive, UTF-8):

- `bash gates/selftest.sh` → `SELFTEST PASS`
- `bash gates/knowledge-test.sh` → `KNOWLEDGE-TEST PASS`, 107 assertions, 0 failures (new suite: the ignore rule, area binding and every refusal, the loop through the link, owner isolation against a `cp -R` copy, CRLF ignore cleanup, readable Unicode store names, retrieval after the checkout is deleted)
- `bash gates/e2e.sh` → `E2E PASS`, 152 assertions, 0 failures
- `bash gates/autotest.sh` → `AUTOTEST PASS`, 195 assertions, 0 failures
- `bash -n` over every changed shell script: clean. `git diff --check`: clean.

The CI matrix runs all four suites on Ubuntu, macOS and Windows Git Bash for
pull requests, main and version tags. The published release notes link the CI
results for the shipped source; earlier runs are not evidence for later edits.

The Windows permission fixture uses a native ACL confined to its temporary
directory and proves an actual write is denied before testing init. Retained
history is searched from a valid directory after the checkout is deleted, with
its evidence bytes and the same query results checked. CRLF preservation is
checked byte by byte, independently of text-mode awk.
