# approve.sh <stage> <artifact-path> [flags] — records a gate approval.
#
# Stages and their one legal artifact: intent→intent.md, spec→spec.md,
# plan→plan.md, ship→evidence.md, all under .sdlc/work/<slug>/ in THIS project.
#
# Intent, spec, and ship approvals are HUMAN decisions: run directly, or
# --delegated after the human's explicit approval in chat. For the plan stage
# ONLY, --agent-adversary records the tiered auto-approval. --lazy records an
# auto-approval for a gate that `lazymode:` in .sdlc/config.md waives (AGENTS.md
# rule 3) and REQUIRES --review "<what was actually reviewed>": lazymode moves
# the human checkpoint, it never removes the review.
# --risk-authorized "<the human's words>" records prior authorization for risky
# work (data loss, public API, security, migrations, external delivery); an
# automated risk hit on the artifact makes it mandatory for --lazy.
#
# Ship, in every mode, also reads the verification verdict (a `blocked` one
# passes only with --accept-gap "<the human's words>") and needs each verifier
# lens VERDICT in evidence.md — docs/automation.md §4.
#
# The record binds: the canonical artifact path, the artifact's sha256, and the
# digests of the upstream artifacts it was approved against — plus, at ship, the
# reviewed code identity. sha256 is CHANGE DETECTION, not authentication.
# The records are gitignored, so the trail is .sdlc/approvals/ in the working
# copy and does not survive a fresh clone.
