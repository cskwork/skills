# indicators per the AI-native SDLC playbook. Default output is BOUNDED:
# open features + the 20 most recently closed. --all reads every archived
# feature, so output grows with the archive — run it deliberately, not from
# an agent loop that only needs current timings. Run from the project root
# (needs .sdlc/).
