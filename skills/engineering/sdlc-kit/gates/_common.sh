# --- reviewed source identity ------------------------------------------------
# The ship review is a review of the project's SOURCE, so the ship approval binds
# the whole source snapshot — not only the part that happened to be uncommitted:
#   every tracked file + every untracked file git does not ignore, minus .sdlc/.
# Everything about that is deliberate:
#   - work COMMITTED BEFORE the review is bound too (a diff-vs-HEAD set is empty
#     in that case and would bind nothing at all),
#   - staging or committing the same bytes changes nothing — the snapshot is
#     content, never index or commit identity,
#   - a file added, removed, chmod'ed, or turned into a symlink after the review
#     is drift, and so is an edit to a file the review did not name. A source
#     change nobody reviewed must not close silently.
# .sdlc/ is excluded: evidence.md, delivery.md, and the approval record live
# there and are written after the review — a binding covering them could never
# match itself. Submodule contents are NOT bound (the gitlink is, by path only).
#
# Path names are line-based. `core.quotepath=off` prints Unicode and spaces
# verbatim, but git still C-quotes a name that contains a tab, a newline, a
# double quote, or a backslash (`"we\"ird.txt"`). Such a line is not a path on
# disk, so it can be neither hashed nor watched — and a stable placeholder for it
# would bind nothing while looking bound. Those names are UNSUPPORTED: they are
# reported as `unsupported` entries, approve.sh refuses to bind a snapshot that
# has one, and sdlc_source_state answers `invalid` for as long as one exists.
# A name that is missing on disk is different and stays `missing`: a tracked
# file deleted in the worktree is an ordinary state the review can look at.
